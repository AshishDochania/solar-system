# üåå 3D Solar System Simulation

## **Overview**
This project is a **real-time 3D simulation of the solar system** using **Three.js**, a powerful JavaScript library for rendering 3D graphics in the browser. The simulation features:
- **Accurate planetary orbits** with realistic motion.
- **Interactive speed controls** to adjust individual planet rotations.
- **Immersive lighting and shadow effects** for better visuals.
- **Pause/Resume animation button** for user control.
- **Background stars** created dynamically for added depth.
- **Planet labels and hover tooltips** displaying names.
- **Dark/Light mode toggle** to switch UI themes.

## **Features**
‚úÖ **Smooth orbit animations** with frame-rate independence using `THREE.Clock`  
‚úÖ **Mobile-responsive design** for compatibility across devices  
‚úÖ **User-controlled orbital speeds** via interactive sliders  
‚úÖ **Pause/Resume button** for controlling animation flow  
‚úÖ **Hover tooltips for planet names** using mouse detection  
‚úÖ **Dark/Light mode toggle** for custom UI preferences  
‚úÖ **Background stars** rendered dynamically
